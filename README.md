ü§ñ AI-Powered Visualization using Quadratic AI
This project also explores the use of AI tools like Quadratic AI to make data analysis faster and easier. With AI-based platforms, you can:
Automatically generate visualizations based on natural language queries.Perform data cleaning and preprocessing using AI-assisted suggestions.
Easily explore complex patterns and relationships without deep knowledge of SQL or coding.Interact with your dataset using a spreadsheet-like interface powered by Python and AI models.
By integrating tools like Quadratic AI, data visualization becomes more accessible, intuitive, and collaborative, even for non-technical users.
